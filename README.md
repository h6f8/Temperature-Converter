Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter project focuses on creating a web-based tool that allows users to convert temperature values between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can input a value in one unit and instantly see the converted values in the other units. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and perform the temperature conversion calculations.
